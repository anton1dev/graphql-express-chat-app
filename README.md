# GraphQL + WS + Express + React Chat App 

Here I've implemented simple Chat Application, which provides an ability to message in real-time.

User can swap text messages one by one, seeing a messages history as well as other user names on the screen.

## Deploy links

- **Client**: https://graphql-chat-client-376cae269bc2.herokuapp.com/ 
- **API with GraphQL Apollo Server**: https://graphql-chat-server-aa595544a3a1.herokuapp.com/

Truly hope you'll enjoy using this Chat App!

## Technologies I've used here 

According to implement both back- and front-end parts, I've used several JS libs and technologies:

- `JavaScript` as well as the main programming language for Web-development;
- `Express.js` as based framework for creating web-server that contains API;
- `Apollo Server` and `Apollo Client`, first for back-end, second - for client implementation;
- `GraphQL` as query language that makes development much more simple;
- `React`, probably the best JS-library for front-end projects :) ;
- `WS` module on my way to create a full-stack Application on WebSocket technology;
- `JWT` as simple but reliable lib to implement user's authentication;
- `ESLint`, `Prettier`, `Husky` for best code-style;
- `dotenv`, `cors`, `minimist` and so on Node.js internal modules.

## Description 

This App consists of real-time Chat, where every authenticated user 

Every single user should login before start messaging.

To test this App, you can switch onto ***bob*** username and ***bob123*** password.

On the way to test App in double-users mode, just open an App window in other web-browser (either on other device!), and use ***alice*** and ***alice123*** credentials.

## Instructions

Just run a deploy link, login and enjoy!
